Plugin Name: Ryans Suckerfish WordPress Dropdown Menu
Plugin URI: https://geek.hellyer.kiwi/suckerfish-wordpress-plugin/
Description: This plugin loads a suckerfish script for providing support for older browsers such as Internet Explorer 6. Must be used with an unordered list with a class of .sf-menu. <strong>Note:</strong> Users upgrading from v1.6.6 should change to the <a href="https://geek.hellyer.kiwi/pixopoint-menu/">PixoPoint Menu plugin</a> instead. Version 2.0 of this plugin removes much of the functionality found in previous versions.
