== FAQ ==
= What is the difference between Community Comments and LiveComments?=

[Livefyre Community Comments](http://www.livefyre.com/comments/) is our free comments plugin for bloggers and small publishers. [LiveComments](http://www.livefyre.com/streamhub/#liveComments) is part of our paid [StreamHub product suite](http://www.livefyre.com/streamhub/) for large publishers. Community Comments runs on the Livefyre network, so you will need a Livefyre account to leave a comment. Each our LiveComments customers run on their own custom network, so you will need an account with that network to leave a comment.  

= Why doesn't my Livefyre plugin work? =

The Livefyre Community Comments plugin depends on a couple different WordPress conventions to work properly. Here are the most common reasons why Livefyre commenting widget does not show up.

1. You are lacking wp_footer() function in your footer.php of your WordPress theme.
 You can add it to your theme by editing your footer.php file, then appending <?php wp_footer() ?> on a new line at the end of the file.

2. Your theme is not using the comments_template() function to load comments.
 The Livefyre Community Comments plugin hooks onto the comments_template() function to insert Community Comments onto the page. Look at the default theme to see how it is implemented and add it into your theme accordingly. You will need to add <?php comments_template() ?> where you want Community Comments to appear on the page.

3. The post or page in question has comments disabled.
 Community Comments will only show up on WordPress posts and pages that have comments enabled. If you go to the Livefyre Settings page in the WordPress admin, you will see a list of post and pages which have comments disabled.

4. You have turned off "Display Posts" or "Display Pages" in the Livefyre Settings page.
 There are options to enable or disable Community Comments on all posts or all pages. If you are missing comments on all your pages, please make sure the Display Pages is checked in the settings page. By default, comments are enabled on posts and pages.

= What are all of these transient_livefyre values in my WordPress options table? =

By default, the Community Comments plugin will cache the static HTML of the comment widget for every page and post Community Comments appears on into transient values in the WordPress options table for performance purposes. These values are temporary, and will be deleted by WordPress cron jobs periodically. You can turn off caching in the Livefyre Settings page, but doing so will incur a sizable performance penalty. You can also delete all transient_livefyre values in the Livefyre Settings page.

= Can I change the language of the Community Comments module? =

Yes. With new feature in v4.1.0, plugin site owners can now choose which language to display on the comment module. Currently, site owners can choose between English, French, Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese.

= 2.37 =
* Added 'copy my comments' button for those who decide to import or who need to sync comments.  Unfortunately until our 'full sync' solution is complete, the button is kind of dumb and is there all the time.  It can't hurt tho - we'll never duplicate a comment thats already in the livefyre system.
* Added automated test for wp_head() template hook, to proactively notify users of compatibility issues.
= 2.36 =
* Improved the automated importer - it now limits the maximum number of queries to run for one chunk of xml (20) in addition to limiting the number of characters that are allowed in one chunk.
* Improved the automated importer - using local dates where GMT is unavailable on very old articles, presumably from versions of WP that didn't track gmt.

= 2.26 =
* Adding phone-home on activation/deactivation of plugin, we now store the status on a Livefyre server for debugging purposes.

* Making the livefyre interface behave correctly on pages (eg 'About') as well as posts.
* Not showing the livefyre interface on preview mode - this was breaking the title grabber.
* Only showing approved pingbacks/trackbacks.
